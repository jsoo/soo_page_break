# soo_page_break

This is a plugin for [Textpattern](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern). It provides a suite of tags 
for handling articles with body text marked up according to a couple of very simple rules: indicate page 
breaks with “[break]” (or another delimiter of your choice), and somewhere after the break put a heading 
element (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) containing the title for that page.

See http://ipsedixit.net/txp/157/soo_page_break for full details, or go ahead and install by copying the 
full contents of the latest compiled version in /releases and pasting into the 
[Textpattern plugin installer](https://docs.textpattern.io/administration/plugins-panel).
